# This file can be left empty for now in a simplified setup
# If you plan to expand your application with more modules or blueprints,
# you can import them here and initialize them if necessary.
# For a simple application, this file may remain empty or just include basic imports.

# Example of potential future imports:
# from .some_module import SomeBlueprint

# If using blueprints, you might register them here:
# app.register_blueprint(SomeBlueprint)
